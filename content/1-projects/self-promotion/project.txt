Title: Self-Promotion

----

Text: This project explore the art of self promotion through the presentation of graphic design work in the context of an exhibition. The product mimics that of a Nintendo 64 video game box, symbolising the era and environment in which I grew up in. Throughout the packaging, hints of my personality and characteristics are reflected in the illustrations and descriptions using a comical tone.
