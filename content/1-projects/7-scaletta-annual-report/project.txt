Title: Scaletta â€“ Annual Report

----

Text: An annual report inspired by New York's National Crime Syndicate that was established in 1929. The report includes figures and falsified information to legitimise the income of the *business*. The design of the report draws on a combination of American Art Deco and modernist typography. The report was bound to mimic a restaurant menu to diverge away from the criminal activity.
