Title: 3010 – Melbourne University magazine (online)

----

Text: For many years, the Melbourne University Magazine explored a diverse array of topics encompassing all University faculties, with a particular focus on interdisciplinary research and impact.
With its new identity of 3010, the website was optimised for both desktop screens as well handheld devices – providing a seamless reading experience across all devices. 3010 online was also developed to be maintained by internal staff and updated on a regular basis.

*The website is powered by Wordpress and is using DW Wallpress as a framework.*
