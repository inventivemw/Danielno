Title: New Trix

----

Text: A series of posters to promote research at The Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories with the use of natural cell therapies that help fight the diseases of ageing, in particular arthritis and diabetes in animals.
The posters follow a minimalistic illustration approach to uplift the negative connotations of stem cell research and to make the campaign more welcoming.
