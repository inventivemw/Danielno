Title: About

----

Text: I call myself a digital designer as it is a nice umbrella term that encapsulates everything I enjoy; web design, animation, programming, icon design, illustration, 3D modelling, print design â€“ having most of these skills inherited from multidisciplinary design courses over the period of studying in multimedia and visual communication.

However, specialising in a graphic design course allows me to visualise the possibilities within a design project without sacrificing aesthetics over a technical handicap such as software capabilities or interpreting web languages.

I love the career path I have chosen, and enjoy helping other people achieve theirs. So if you think I could be of any help, on big or small projects, design related or tutoring. Please don't hesitate to contact me at [hello@danielno.com](mailto:hello@danielno.com "hello@danielno")
