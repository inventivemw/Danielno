Text: Welcome to my slightly abridged portfolio. The work below are things I had done over the years of studying and freelancing. I specialise in graphic and web development that are sensitive to context and devices. I conceptualise, research and design things for people with small and large visions. <em>If you would like to collaborate on a project - please don't hesitate by contacting me at <a href="mailto:hello@danielno.com">hello@danielno.com</a>.</em>
